/**
 * Rating is a generalized class to hold ratings data about a user's performance in fulfilling
 * tasks they have agreed to perform. A rating is comprised of 4 things:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>An aggregate average of all categories</li>
 *     <li>A TTC, or time-to-completion rating reflecting the speed of completion by provider</li>
 *     <li>A prof, or professionalism rating of how courteous, etc. the provider was</li>
 *     <li>A quality, or quality rating based on the workmanship of a task</li>
 * </ul>
